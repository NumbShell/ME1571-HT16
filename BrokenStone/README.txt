My most complex game to date, I set out with the intention of
recreating Hearthstone in a sense, of course I took plenty of water
over my head and with shortage of time I'm abandoning this project, for now anyway.
(Not a game by definition since you can't win nor lose.)


Note that the game is in a fixed resolution of 1920 by 1200.
