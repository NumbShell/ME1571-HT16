SCAN: Scans the map for other ships like a radar, and 
only show the parts of the ship the radar bounced off
so only their sides would be seen awesome :O


On the website there will also be like a command prompt
where they can type commands to change color of their boat
and perhaps even use that to playthe game like

//move 3LEFT 2UP

//move 10UP 10LEFT
ERROR: Exceeding number of turns 5

//color RED
MSG: Applied colour red to ship
